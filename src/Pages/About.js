				<p>
			In the U.S alone, 80 billion pounds of food are thrown away yearly. Food takes up more space in US landfills than anything else. Much of this is food thrown away by corporations and restaurants who have perfectly edible leftovers that may expire and people do not want to buy. However, these businesses do not typically have time or resources to donate these items, and they must be thrown away. Our goal is provide our communities with food that would alternatively have gone to waste.

			We connect local restaurants and grocery stores who have extra produce or food at the end of the day, charities like meals on wheels and local homeless shelters,  and users to pick up and deliver it to those in need.
			<br></br>

			We work with businesses such as HEB, Whataburger and many more!
